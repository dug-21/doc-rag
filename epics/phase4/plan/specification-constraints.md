# SPARC Specification: Constraints Document
## Doc-RAG System - 99% Accuracy Implementation

**Document Type**: Technical and Business Constraints Specification  
**Project Phase**: Phase 4 - Critical Path Implementation  
**Target Architecture**: DAA + ruv-FANN + FACT Integration  
**Constraint Enforcement**: Mandatory Compliance Required  
**Status**: ‚ùå CRITICAL - Constraints Must Be Strictly Enforced  

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the non-negotiable constraints that govern the Doc-RAG system's transformation to achieve 99% accuracy. These constraints are **mandatory** and **non-negotiable**. Violation of any constraint will result in system rejection and restart of implementation efforts.

### üö® Constraint Enforcement Philosophy
- **Zero Tolerance**: No exceptions to defined constraints
- **Architecture Mandates**: Use only specified libraries, no custom implementations
- **Timeline Constraint**: 4-week maximum implementation window
- **Quality Gates**: System must pass all constraints before advancement

---

## 1. Architecture Constraints (MANDATORY)

### 1.1 Library Usage Constraints

#### ARCH-CONST-001: ruv-FANN Exclusivity Constraint
**Constraint**: ALL neural network operations MUST use ruv-FANN library exclusively  
**Prohibition**: Zero custom neural network implementations permitted  
**Violation Detection**: Code audit for custom neural implementations  
**Current Violation**: Custom neural code exists alongside ruv-FANN imports  

**Enforcement Rules**:
- [ ] **NO custom neural network structs** (e.g., `struct CustomNetwork`)
- [ ] **NO custom neural implementations** (e.g., `impl NeuralProcessor for Custom`)
- [ ] **NO neural wrapper layers** around ruv-FANN
- [ ] **NO fallback neural implementations** for any scenario
- [ ] **ALL neural operations** must directly use ruv-FANN API

**Validation Method**:
```bash
# Automated constraint violation detection
grep -r "struct.*Network" src/ | grep -v "ruv_fann" && echo "VIOLATION: Custom neural structs found"
grep -r "impl.*Neural" src/ | grep -v "ruv_fann" && echo "VIOLATION: Custom neural implementations found"
grep -r "trait.*Neural" src/ | grep -v "ruv_fann" && echo "VIOLATION: Custom neural traits found"
```

**Consequence of Violation**: Immediate implementation restart required

#### ARCH-CONST-002: DAA-Orchestrator Exclusivity Constraint
**Constraint**: ALL agent orchestration MUST use DAA-orchestrator library exclusively  
**Prohibition**: Zero custom agent coordination implementations permitted  
**Current Violation**: DAA-orchestrator wrapped in custom coordination code  

**Enforcement Rules**:
- [ ] **NO custom orchestration structs** (e.g., `struct CustomOrchestrator`)
- [ ] **NO custom agent coordination** implementations
- [ ] **NO wrapper layers** around DAA-orchestrator
- [ ] **NO manual agent management** - all via DAA-orchestrator
- [ ] **ALL MRAP operations** must use DAA-orchestrator directly

**Validation Method**:
```bash
# DAA constraint violation detection
grep -r "struct.*Orchestr" src/ | grep -v "daa" && echo "VIOLATION: Custom orchestration found"
grep -r "impl.*Agent" src/ | grep -v "daa" && echo "VIOLATION: Custom agent management found"
grep -r "manage_agents\|coordinate_agents" src/ | grep -v "daa" && echo "VIOLATION: Manual agent coordination found"
```

**Consequence of Violation**: Complete orchestration layer redesign required

#### ARCH-CONST-003: FACT System Exclusivity Constraint
**Constraint**: ALL caching operations MUST use FACT library exclusively  
**Prohibition**: Redis, custom caches, or any non-FACT caching forbidden  
**Current Violation**: FACT library completely disabled, Redis still present  

**Enforcement Rules**:
- [ ] **NO Redis usage** - Redis dependencies must be removed
- [ ] **NO custom cache implementations** (e.g., `struct CustomCache`)
- [ ] **NO in-memory cache alternatives** to FACT
- [ ] **NO cache abstraction layers** over FACT
- [ ] **ALL caching operations** must use FACT directly

**Validation Method**:
```bash
# FACT constraint violation detection
grep -r "redis" Cargo.toml && echo "VIOLATION: Redis dependency found"
grep -r "struct.*Cache" src/ | grep -v "fact" && echo "VIOLATION: Custom cache implementation found"
grep -r "impl.*Cache" src/ | grep -v "fact" && echo "VIOLATION: Custom cache traits found"
```

**Consequence of Violation**: Complete caching redesign required

### 1.2 Implementation Prohibition Constraints

#### ARCH-CONST-004: Custom Implementation Prohibition
**Constraint**: ZERO custom implementations of capabilities provided by mandated libraries  
**Scope**: Neural processing, agent orchestration, intelligent caching  
**Current Violation**: Multiple custom implementations exist alongside library imports  

**Prohibited Implementations**:
- [ ] **Custom neural networks** for any purpose
- [ ] **Custom agent coordination** systems  
- [ ] **Custom caching mechanisms** beyond FACT
- [ ] **Custom consensus algorithms** beyond DAA
- [ ] **Custom ML models** not using ruv-FANN
- [ ] **Wrapper abstractions** that hide direct library usage

**Enforcement**: Daily code audit during implementation

#### ARCH-CONST-005: Direct Integration Constraint  
**Constraint**: Libraries must be integrated directly without abstraction layers  
**Prohibition**: No wrapper classes, adapter patterns, or abstraction layers  
**Rationale**: Ensures proper library utilization and prevents hidden custom implementations  

**Required Integration Pattern**:
```rust
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Direct library usage
use ruv_fann::Network;
use daa_orchestrator::Orchestrator;
use fact::Cache;

// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Wrapper abstractions
struct NeuralWrapper {
    inner: ruv_fann::Network, // Don't wrap the library
}

struct CacheAdapter {
    fact_cache: fact::Cache, // Don't adapt the library
}
```

```

**Implementation**: Automated checking of constraint compliance  
**Frequency**: Every commit and daily comprehensive check  
**Action**: Automatic build failure on constraint violation  

**Automated Checks**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily constraint enforcement script

echo "=== ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINT VALIDATION ==="
./scripts/validate-architecture-constraints.sh || exit 1

echo "=== PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINT VALIDATION ==="  
./scripts/validate-performance-constraints.sh || exit 1

echo "=== INTEGRATION CONSTRAINT VALIDATION ==="
./scripts/validate-integration-constraints.sh || exit 1

echo "=== SCOPE CONSTRAINT VALIDATION ==="
./scripts/validate-scope-constraints.sh || exit 1

echo "‚úÖ ALL CONSTRAINTS SATISFIED"
```

### 10.2 Manual Constraint Reviews

#### ENF-002: Daily Architecture Compliance Reviews
**Schedule**: Every day at end of development  
**Participants**: Full development team  
**Duration**: 30 minutes maximum  
**Focus**: Architecture constraint compliance verification  

**Review Agenda**:
1. Library usage compliance check (5 minutes)
2. Custom implementation detection (5 minutes)  
3. Integration progress validation (10 minutes)
4. Tomorrow's constraint compliance plan (10 minutes)

### 10.3 Constraint Violation Response

#### ENF-003: Violation Response Protocol
**Detection**: Any constraint violation must be immediately addressed  
**Priority**: Constraint violations take priority over feature development  
**Resolution**: Violation must be resolved before any other work continues  

**Response Procedure**:
1. **Immediate Stop**: All development stops upon violation detection
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Understand why violation occurred  
3. **Violation Resolution**: Fix violation completely
4. **Prevention Update**: Update enforcement to prevent recurrence
5. **Resume Development**: Only after violation completely resolved
