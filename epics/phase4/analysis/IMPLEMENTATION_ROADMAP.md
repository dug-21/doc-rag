# Implementation Roadmap: Achieving 99% Accuracy

## Executive Overview

This roadmap provides a **4-week critical path** to transform the current 52% implementation into a fully functional 99% accuracy RAG system.

---

## Week 1: Emergency Foundation Fixes (Jan 7-13)

### Day 1-2: Dependency Resolution
- [ ] Enable FACT in all Cargo.toml files
- [ ] Remove competing ML libraries (linfa, smartcore, candle)
- [ ] Fix compilation errors from dependency conflicts
- [ ] Verify all three core libraries import correctly

### Day 3-4: Component Connection
- [ ] Connect chunker to main application pipeline
- [ ] Wire embedder to storage layer
- [ ] Link query processor to response generator
- [ ] Establish basic end-to-end flow

### Day 5: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run integration tests on connected pipeline
- [ ] Validate basic functionality works
- [ ] Document remaining integration issues
- [ ] Checkpoint: 65% implementation complete

**Deliverable**: Working end-to-end pipeline with core libraries enabled

---

## Week 2: Core Integration & Compliance (Jan 14-20)

### Day 1-2: ruv-FANN Integration
```rust
// Replace ALL custom neural code
use ruv_fann::{Network, ChunkBoundaryDetector};

impl NeuralChunker {
    pub fn chunk_with_neural(&self, text: &str) -> Vec<Chunk> {
        // USE ruv-FANN, not custom implementation
        let detector = ChunkBoundaryDetector::new();
        detector.find_semantic_boundaries(text)
    }
}
```

### Day 3-4: DAA Orchestration Implementation
```rust
// Implement complete MRAP loop
use daa_orchestrator::{Agent, MRAPLoop, Consensus};

impl QueryOrchestrator {
    pub async fn process_query(&self, query: &str) -> Response {
        let mrap = MRAPLoop::new();
        mrap.monitor()    // Real-time monitoring
            .reason()     // Intelligent decisions
            .act()        // Execute strategy
            .reflect()    // Learn from outcome
            .adapt()      // Adjust approach
            .await
    }
}
```

### Day 5: FACT System Activation
```rust
// Enable intelligent caching
use fact::{Cache, CitationTracker};

impl ResponseCache {
    pub async fn get_or_compute(&self, query: &str) -> Response {
        // Check FACT cache first (<50ms)
        if let Some(cached) = self.fact_cache.get(query).await {
            return cached;
        }
        // Compute and cache
    }
}
```

**Deliverable**: Fully compliant architecture with mandated libraries

---

## Week 3: Accuracy Enhancement (Jan 21-27)

### Day 1-2: Byzantine Consensus Implementation
```rust
use daa_orchestrator::byzantine::{ByzantineConsensus, Threshold};

impl ValidationEngine {
    pub async fn validate(&self, responses: Vec<Response>) -> ValidatedResponse {
        let consensus = ByzantineConsensus::new(Threshold::TwoThirds);
        consensus.validate_with_threshold(responses, 0.66).await
    }
}
```

### Day 3-4: Multi-Layer Validation
- [ ] Implement syntax validation with ruv-FANN
- [ ] Add semantic validation with embeddings
- [ ] Enable factual validation with FACT
- [ ] Integrate consensus validation with DAA

### Day 5: Citation Pipeline
```rust
use fact::{CitationExtractor, SourceMapper};

impl CitationSystem {
    pub fn generate_citations(&self, response: &Response) -> Citations {
        let extractor = CitationExtractor::new();
        let claims = extractor.extract_claims(response);
        let mapper = SourceMapper::new();
        mapper.map_claims_to_sources(claims)
    }
}
```

**Deliverable**: Complete validation and citation system

## Week 4: Performance & Production (Jan 28-Feb 3)

### Day 1-2: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable parallel processing in DAA
- [ ] Optimize ruv-FANN inference (<200ms)
- [ ] Tune FACT cache parameters (<50ms)
- [ ] Achieve <2s end-to-end response

### Day 3-4: Accuracy Validation
- [ ] Run accuracy benchmarks on PCI DSS dataset
- [ ] Validate 99% accuracy achievement
- [ ] Tune model parameters if needed
- [ ] Document accuracy metrics

### Day 5: Production Readiness
- [ ] Complete Docker deployment
- [ ] Enable Kubernetes orchestration

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **FACT Integration Conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Dedicated engineer for dependency resolution
   - Fallback: Gradual migration if compilation issues persist

2. **Performance Regression**
   - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking during integration
   - Fallback: Selective optimization of critical paths

3. **Consensus Overhead**
   - Mitigation: Async consensus for non-critical validations
   - Fallback: Adjustable threshold based on query type

---

## Resource Requirements

### Team Composition
- **Lead Architect**: Full-time oversight and integration
- **2 Senior Engineers**: Core library integration
- **1 Performance Engineer**: Optimization and benchmarking
- **1 QA Engineer**: Accuracy validation and testing

### Infrastructure
- Development cluster with GPU support for ruv-FANN
- MongoDB cluster for distributed storage
- Redis cluster for auxiliary caching
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)

---

## Daily Standup Focus

"Are all components connected and talking?"

### Week 2
"Is every line of code using the mandated libraries?"

### Week 3
"What's our current accuracy measurement?"

### Week 4

## Conclusion

This roadmap transforms the current sophisticated but disconnected system into a unified, compliant, and highly accurate RAG platform. Success depends on:

1. **Strict adherence** to mandated libraries
2. **No new features** during integration period
3. **Daily progress tracking** against milestones
4. **Zero tolerance** for architectural violations

With focused execution, the 99% accuracy vision is achievable within 4 weeks.
