## Development Workflow

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning Standup** (15 min)
   - Review previous day's progress
   - Plan day's tasks
   - Identify blockers

2. **Development Blocks** (3-4 hours each)
   - Focus on single building block
   - Write tests first
   - Implement functionality
   - Run benchmarks

3. **End of Day**
   - Commit working code
   - Update documentation
   - Plan next day

### Code Review Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement with tests
3. Self-review checklist
4. Push and create PR
5. Automated CI checks
6. Manual review
7. Merge to develop
8. Deploy to staging

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests (Per Component)
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_component_initialization() {
        // Test setup
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_core_functionality() {
        // Main feature test
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_error_handling() {
        // Error cases
    }
    
    #[bench]
    fn bench_performance() {
        // Performance benchmark
    }
}
```

#### Integration Tests
```rust
// tests/integration.rs
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_end_to_end_flow() {
    // Full pipeline test
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **MongoDB Vector Search Performance**
   - Mitigation: Benchmark early, have fallback to dedicated vector DB
   - Contingency: Implement Qdrant or Weaviate adapter

2. **MCP Protocol Changes**
   - Mitigation: Abstract protocol details
   - Contingency: Version lock, gradual migration

3. **Memory Usage in Embedding**
   - Mitigation: Batch processing, streaming
   - Contingency: Horizontal scaling

4. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Clear interfaces, extensive testing
   - Contingency: Simplify scope for Phase 1

### Schedule Risks

1. **Rust Learning Curve**
   - Mitigation: Pair programming, code reviews
   - Buffer: 20% time allocation for learning

2. **Docker/K8s Setup**
   - Mitigation: Use existing templates
   - Buffer: 2 days allocated for DevOps

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - Mitigation: TDD approach
   - Buffer: 25% of dev time for testing
