# Current vs Target Architecture

## Overview

This document compares our current manual implementation with the target architecture leveraging ruv-swarm DAA (Decentralized Autonomous Agents) and claude-flow orchestration libraries.

## Target Architecture (With Libraries)

### 1. DAA Orchestration (ruv-swarm)
**Library-Powered Implementation:**
```javascript
// Initialize autonomous agent swarm
await mcp__ruv_swarm__daa_init({
    enableCoordination: true,
    enableLearning: true,
    persistenceMode: "auto"
});

// Self-organizing agents with Byzantine fault tolerance
await mcp__ruv_swarm__daa_agent_create({
    id: "chunker-coordinator",
    cognitivePattern: "adaptive",
    capabilities: ["document-analysis", "boundary-detection", "quality-assessment"]
});
```

**Benefits:**
- **90% code reduction** - From 2,000+ lines to ~100 lines
- **Built-in Byzantine consensus** - No manual voting logic
- **Self-healing with MRAP loop** - Automatic error recovery
- **Autonomous decision-making** - Agents adapt without human intervention
- **Distributed coordination** - Native multi-node support

### 2. ruv-FANN Neural Chunker
**Neural Implementation:**
```javascript
// Neural boundary detection with 27+ architectures
await mcp__claude_flow__neural_train({
    pattern_type: "boundary-detection",
    training_data: document_corpus,
    epochs: 50
});

// Adaptive chunking based on content understanding
await mcp__ruv_swarm__neural_patterns({
    pattern: "adaptive",
    action: "analyze"
});
```

**Benefits:**

### 3. FACT-Accelerated Responses (claude-flow)
**Intelligent Caching:**
```javascript
// Sub-50ms cached responses with intelligent invalidation
await mcp__claude_flow__memory_usage({
    action: "store",
    key: "query-cache",
    namespace: "fact-responses",
    ttl: 3600000  // Smart TTL based on content freshness
});

// Natural language query understanding
await mcp__claude_flow__neural_predict({
    modelId: "query-intent-classifier",
    input: user_query
});
```

**Benefits:**
- **Sub-50ms cached responses** - 100x faster than re-processing
- **Natural language understanding** - No manual pattern matching
- **Intelligent cache invalidation** - Content-aware expiration
- **Tool-based architecture** - Composable query processors
- **Cross-session memory** - Persistent learning across restarts

### 4. Autonomous Query Processing
**Agent-Based Processing:**
```javascript
// Orchestrate multi-agent query processing
await mcp__ruv_swarm__task_orchestrate({
    task: "Process user query with semantic understanding",
    strategy: "adaptive",
    priority: "high"
});

// Autonomous workflow execution
await mcp__ruv_swarm__daa_workflow_execute({
    workflow_id: "rag-pipeline",
