## üéØ PHASE 1 MISSION STATEMENT

**Goal**: Transform the existing traditional RAG system into a neurosymbolic RAG system by implementing core symbolic reasoning, graph database integration, and smart ingestion capabilities.

**Core Innovation**: Implement "Smart Ingestion" - the key differentiator where documents are processed intelligently at load time rather than repeatedly at query time, following the principle "An Ounce of Prevention."
