└── Temporal Dimensions
    ├── Effective Dates
    ├── Retirement Dates
    └── Future-dated Markers
```

### Critical Data Attributes

#### Requirement-Level Attributes
- **Unique Identifier**: Hierarchical numbering (8.2.2)
- **Effective Date**: When requirement becomes mandatory
- **Retirement Date**: When requirement is superseded
- **Future-Dated Flag**: Boolean for 2025 requirements
- **Risk Level**: Implicit priority/criticality
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and related requirements

#### Cross-Reference Structures
- **Internal Links**: Requirement-to-requirement references
- **FAQ Mappings**: Question-to-requirement associations
- **Change Tracking**: Version-to-version evolution
- **Testing Procedures**: Implementation validation steps

#### Temporal Tracking
- **Version Timeline**: 3.2.1 → 4.0 → 4.0.1 progression
- **Requirement Lifecycle**: Introduction → Active → Future-dated → Mandatory
- **Document Updates**: Change summaries and impact analysis

## 4. Citation and Reference Patterns

### Standard Citation Formats
- **Requirements**: "PCI-DSS Requirement 8.2.2"
- **Sections**: "Section 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data"
- **Testing**: "Testing Procedure 8.2.2.a"
- **Cross-Standards**: "PA-DSS Requirement 4.1"

### FAQ Reference Patterns
- **Direct Mapping**: FAQ → Specific Requirement
- **Multi-Mapping**: FAQ → Multiple Requirements
- **Contextual References**: FAQ → General Guidance Areas
- **Version-Specific**: FAQ → Version Transition Guidance

## 5. Storage Strategy Implications

### Document Chunking Strategy
1. **Requirement-Level Chunks**: Individual requirements as base units
2. **Section-Level Context**: Maintain category groupings
3. **Cross-Reference Preservation**: Embedded link structures
4. **Version Layering**: Historical context maintenance

### Metadata Requirements
```json
{
  "requirement_id": "8.2.2",
  "version": "4.0.1",
  "category": "Strong Access Control Measures",
  "effective_date": "2024-03-31",
  "future_dated": false,
  "cross_references": ["8.2.1", "8.2.3", "FAQ-AUTH-001"],
  "testing_procedures": ["8.2.2.a", "8.2.2.b"],
  "change_summary": "Modified from v4.0 - clarified multi-factor authentication requirements"
}
```

### Vector Embedding Considerations
- **Semantic Similarity**: Requirement content and intent
- **FAQ Alignment**: Question-answer pair matching
- **Cross-Reference Clustering**: Related requirement groupings
- **Temporal Proximity**: Version-based similarity

## 6. Query Pattern Implications

### Expected Query Types

#### Direct Lookup Queries
- "What is PCI-DSS Requirement 8.2.2?"
- "When do future-dated requirements become mandatory?"
- "What changed between PCI-DSS 4.0 and 4.0.1?"

#### Contextual Analysis Queries
- "How do authentication requirements apply to small merchants?"
- "What are the encryption requirements for stored cardholder data?"
- "How should we implement multi-factor authentication?"

#### Cross-Reference Queries
- "What other requirements relate to password policies?"
- "Which FAQ entries address network segmentation?"
- "How do PCI-DSS requirements interact with GDPR?"

#### Compliance Planning Queries
- "What requirements become mandatory in 2025?"
- "How should we prioritize PCI-DSS 4.0.1 implementation?"
- "What documentation is needed for requirement 12.5.2?"

## 7. Recommendations for Data Loading

### Primary Loading Strategy
1. **Requirement-Centric**: Use individual requirements as primary chunks
2. **Context-Preserved**: Maintain hierarchical relationships
3. **Cross-Linked**: Embed reference structures in metadata
4. **Version-Aware**: Track temporal dimensions explicitly

### Secondary Enrichment
1. **FAQ Integration**: Map FAQ entries to relevant requirements
2. **Change Tracking**: Preserve version evolution context
3. **Testing Procedures**: Link validation steps to requirements
4. **Implementation Guidance**: Associate practical guidance with requirements

### Quality Assurance
1. **Reference Validation**: Verify all cross-references resolve correctly
2. **Version Consistency**: Ensure temporal relationships are accurate
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Confirm all requirement categories are represented
4. **FAQ Coverage**: Validate FAQ-requirement mappings

## 8. Success Metrics

### Coverage Metrics
- **Requirement Coverage**: 100% of PCI-DSS 4.0.1 requirements indexed
- **FAQ Coverage**: 100% of current FAQ entries mapped
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: 100% of internal references resolvable

### Query Performance Metrics
- **Direct Lookup Accuracy**: >95% for specific requirement queries
- **Contextual Relevance**: >90% for multi-requirement scenarios
- **Citation Accuracy**: 100% for requirement number and version citations

### User Experience Metrics
- **Response Completeness**: Users find answers without follow-up queries
- **Confidence Level**: High user confidence in provided guidance
- **Compliance Utility**: Answers directly support compliance activities

## Conclusion

PCI-DSS represents a complex domain requiring sophisticated data structuring to support effective RAG-based question answering. The hierarchical nature, cross-references, temporal dimensions, and practical application patterns demand a multi-layered approach to data loading and storage. Success will depend on preserving the standard's inherent structure while optimizing for the diverse query patterns typical of compliance and implementation use cases.
