- No pre-computed fact extraction during loading

## Strategic Neural Loading Framework

### 1. Intelligent Semantic Chunking

#### Semantic Boundary Detection
```
Traditional: Fixed-size chunks with overlap
Neural Approach: Context-aware semantic boundaries
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Multi-level Boundary Detection:**
  - Document structure (chapters, sections, subsections)
  - Paragraph-level semantic coherence
  - Sentence-level topical shifts
  - Entity and concept boundaries

- **Context-Aware Chunking:**
  - Preserve complete thoughts and arguments
  - Maintain entity-relationship contexts
  - Respect narrative flow and logical progression
  - Handle multi-modal content (text, tables, code, diagrams)

**Optimization Benefits:**
- Reduces query-time context reconstruction costs
- Improves retrieval accuracy through semantic coherence
- Minimizes information fragmentation

#### Advanced Chunk Metadata
Extend current metadata extraction with:

```rust
struct NeuralChunkMetadata {
    // Existing metadata plus:
    semantic_cluster_id: Uuid,
    discourse_markers: Vec<DiscourseMarker>,
    entity_density: f32,
    concept_hierarchy: ConceptNode,
    cross_references: Vec<InternalReference>,
    fact_density: f32,
    argumentation_structure: ArgumentChain,
}
```

### 2. Hierarchical Document Architecture

#### Multi-Level Indexing System
```
Level 1: Document-wide concepts and themes
Level 2: Section-level topics and subtopics  
Level 3: Paragraph-level details and facts
Level 4: Sentence-level specific information
```

**Implementation:**
- **Hierarchical Vector Embeddings:**
  - Document-level abstract embeddings
  - Section-level topic embeddings
  - Chunk-level detailed embeddings
  - Cross-level relationship mappings

- **Structural Preservation:**
  - Maintain document outline and hierarchy
  - Preserve heading relationships and nesting
  - Track cross-references and citations
  - Map table-of-contents to content structures

**Query Optimization:**
- Route queries to appropriate hierarchy levels
- Eliminate need for full-document scanning
- Enable progressive detail refinement

### 3. Entity-Centric Preprocessing

#### Real-time Entity Recognition During Loading
```python
class NeuralEntityProcessor:
    def extract_entities(self, chunk: DocumentChunk) -> EntityGraph:
        """Extract and link entities during document processing"""
        entities = self.ner_model.extract(chunk.content)
        relationships = self.relation_extractor.find_relations(entities)
        return EntityGraph(entities, relationships)
```

**Entity Categories:**
- **Named Entities:** People, organizations, locations, dates
- **Conceptual Entities:** Technical terms, domain concepts, processes
- **Numerical Entities:** Metrics, measurements, statistical data
- **Temporal Entities:** Events, timelines, sequences

#### Entity Relationship Mapping
Pre-compute entity relationships during loading:
- **Co-occurrence Networks:** Entities appearing together
- **Hierarchical Relationships:** Parent-child, part-whole
- **Temporal Relationships:** Before-after, cause-effect
- **Semantic Relationships:** Synonyms, antonyms, related concepts

### 4. Pre-computed Knowledge Graphs

#### Fact Extraction Pipeline
```rust
struct FactExtractionPipeline {
    statement_extractor: StatementExtractor,
    fact_validator: FactValidator,
    knowledge_graph_builder: KnowledgeGraphBuilder,
    contradiction_detector: ContradictionDetector,
}
```

**Fact Categories:**
- **Explicit Facts:** Direct statements and claims
- **Implicit Facts:** Derived from context and reasoning
- **Numerical Facts:** Statistics, measurements, calculations
- **Temporal Facts:** Events, dates, sequences
- **Relational Facts:** Connections between entities

#### Knowledge Graph Construction
- **Triple Store Creation:** Subject-Predicate-Object relationships
- **Confidence Scoring:** Reliability metrics for each fact
- **Source Attribution:** Track fact origins and supporting evidence
- **Contradiction Detection:** Identify conflicting information

### 5. Automatic Taxonomy Generation

#### Dynamic Classification System
```python
class TaxonomyGenerator:
    def build_taxonomy(self, document_corpus: List[Document]) -> Taxonomy:
        """Generate domain-specific taxonomy from document corpus"""
        concepts = self.extract_concepts(document_corpus)
        hierarchy = self.build_concept_hierarchy(concepts)
        return Taxonomy(hierarchy, confidence_scores)
```

**Taxonomy Components:**
- **Concept Extraction:** Identify domain-specific terms and concepts
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Build parent-child relationships
- **Cross-references:** Link related concepts across categories
- **Confidence Scoring:** Rate classification accuracy

### 6. Cross-reference and Citation Network

#### Reference Graph Construction
During document loading, build comprehensive reference networks:

```rust
struct ReferenceNetwork {
    internal_references: HashMap<ChunkId, Vec<ChunkId>>,
    external_citations: HashMap<ChunkId, Vec<ExternalSource>>,
    concept_references: HashMap<ConceptId, Vec<ChunkId>>,
    evidence_chains: Vec<EvidenceChain>,
}
```

**Reference Types:**
- **Direct Citations:** Explicit references to sources
- **Conceptual References:** Implicit connections between ideas
- **Evidence Chains:** Supporting information for claims
- **Cross-document Links:** Connections across multiple documents

### 7. Neural Preprocessing Pipeline Architecture

            chunks,
            entities,
            facts,
            taxonomy,
            embeddings,
            knowledge_graph: self.knowledge_graph.build(&facts, &entities).await?,
        }
    }
}
```

## Query-Time Cost Elimination Strategies

### 1. Pre-computed Query Patterns
During loading, anticipate common query patterns and pre-compute responses:
- **FAQ Generation:** Extract question-answer pairs from content
- **Summary Hierarchies:** Pre-generate summaries at multiple levels
- **Concept Explanations:** Prepare definitions and explanations
- **Comparison Tables:** Pre-build comparison matrices

### 2. Semantic Query Routing
Route queries directly to relevant pre-processed information:
- **Intent Classification:** Direct queries to appropriate content types
- **Entity-based Routing:** Route entity queries to entity graphs
- **Fact Verification:** Use pre-computed fact database for validation
- **Hierarchical Navigation:** Progressive detail revelation

### 3. Context Pre-computation
Pre-build context for common scenarios:
- **Entity Context:** Complete entity profiles with relationships
- **Topic Context:** Comprehensive topic overviews with details
- **Temporal Context:** Event timelines and sequences
- **Causal Context:** Cause-effect relationship chains

## Performance and Accuracy Benefits

### Cost Optimization
- **Reduced LLM Calls:** Pre-processed information eliminates interpretation needs
- **Faster Query Response:** Direct retrieval from pre-computed structures
- **Efficient Resource Usage:** Front-load processing costs during loading
- **Scalable Architecture:** Processing costs don't scale with query volume

### Accuracy Improvements
- **Context Preservation:** Semantic chunking maintains meaning
- **Relationship Awareness:** Entity and fact graphs provide connections
- **Hierarchical Understanding:** Multi-level indexing enables precise retrieval
- **Consistency Validation:** Pre-computed fact checking reduces errors

## Conclusion

This neural data loading strategy provides a comprehensive approach to eliminating query-time LLM interpretation costs while significantly improving retrieval accuracy. By front-loading intelligent preprocessing during document ingestion, the system can provide faster, more accurate, and cost-effective responses to user queries.

The strategy leverages existing system strengths while addressing current limitations through semantic understanding, hierarchical organization, and pre-computed knowledge structures. Implementation should proceed incrementally, building on the solid foundation already established in the codebase.
