## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **FACT Implementation Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple HashMap, iterate
   - Fallback: Use Redis temporarily

2. **Neural Network Performance**
   - Mitigation: Pre-compute embeddings
   - Fallback: CPU inference with batching

3. **MongoDB Scalability**
   - Mitigation: Sharding strategy
   - Fallback: Hybrid with Pinecone

4. **99% Accuracy Target**
   - Mitigation: Incremental improvements
   - Fallback: Accept 95% as MVP

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

### Phase 1 Completion (Week 2)
- ✅ FACT cache working (<50ms)
- ✅ Byzantine consensus fixed (4 nodes)
- ❌ If not → STOP and reassess architecture

### Phase 3 Completion (Week 6)
- ✅ Accuracy >85%
- ✅ Latency <1.5s
- ❌ If not → Pivot to alternative approach

### Phase 5 Completion (Week 10)
- ✅ Accuracy >93%
- ✅ 100+ QPS sustained
- ❌ If not → Adjust 99% target to 95%

## Alternative Approaches

### Plan B: If 99% Unreachable
1. **Hybrid Human-in-the-Loop**
   - 95% automated accuracy
   - Human verification for critical queries
   - Confidence threshold routing

2. **Domain-Specific Fine-tuning**
   - Custom models per document type
   - Specialized retrievers
   - Expert system rules

3. **Ensemble Architecture**
   - Multiple RAG systems voting
   - Weighted consensus
   - Best-of-N selection

Achieving 99% accuracy is ambitious but possible with:
1. Complete implementation of missing components
2. Advanced retrieval techniques
3. Extensive optimization and fine-tuning
4. Realistic timeline of 12 weeks
5. Adequate resources and expertise

**Recommended approach:**
