## 🎯 Neurosymbolic Design Philosophy

### Core Principle: "An Ounce of Prevention"
Process documents intelligently at load time rather than repeatedly at query time.

### Architecture Tenets
1. **Symbolic-First**: Logic programming handles requirements and rules
2. **Neural-Assisted**: ML models classify and extract, but don't generate
3. **Graph-Powered**: Relationships are first-class citizens
4. **Template-Based**: Responses use templates, not free generation
5. **Explainable**: Complete proof chains for all answers

## 🏗️ System Components

### 1. Symbolic Reasoning Layer (Primary)
- **Datalog (Crepe)**: Requirement rules and inference
- **Prolog (Scryer)**: Complex reasoning fallback
- **Logic Parser**: Natural language to formal logic
- **Proof Chain Builder**: Explainable reasoning paths

### 2. Graph Database Layer
- **Neo4j v5.0+**: Relationship storage and traversal
- **Cypher Queries**: Complex relationship queries
- **Document Hierarchy**: Structural relationships
- **Cross-References**: Requirement dependencies

### 3. Neural Classification Layer
- **ruv-fann v0.1.6**: Document/section/query classification
- **<10ms Inference**: Real-time routing decisions
- **No Generation**: Classification only, never text generation
- **Strategic Placement**: Only where neural adds value

### 4. Template Response Layer
- **Structured Templates**: Predefined response formats
- **Variable Substitution**: Dynamic content from proof chains
- **Citation Integration**: Complete source attribution
- **No Hallucination**: Deterministic responses only

### 5. Vector Fallback Layer
- **Qdrant**: Semantic search when symbolic fails
- **High Threshold**: 0.85 confidence minimum
- **<20% Usage**: Most queries use symbolic path
- **Logged Usage**: Identify gaps in symbolic coverage

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Component | Target | Method |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Document Loading | 2-5 pages/sec | Parallel processing, smart extraction |
| Symbolic Query | <100ms | Pre-compiled logic rules |
| Graph Traversal | <200ms | Indexed relationships |
| Vector Fallback | <500ms | Only when necessary |
| End-to-End | <1s | Symbolic-first approach |
| Accuracy | 96-98% | Logic inference + templates |

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- Implement document classifier with ruv-fann
- Set up Datalog engine (crepe)
- Deploy Neo4j for graph storage
- Create basic logic parser

- Implement logic rule builder
- Create graph relationship mapper
- Develop hierarchy extractor

### Phase 3: Query Processing (Weeks 7-9)
- Implement query classifier
- Build symbolic reasoner
- Create graph traverser
- Set up vector fallback

### Phase 4: Response Generation (Weeks 10-12)
- Design response templates
- Build proof chain formatter
- Create citation manager
- Implement confidence scoring

### Phase 5: Integration (Weeks 13-15)
- Integrate with existing modules
- Set up routing logic
- Implement caching layer
- Create monitoring dashboard

### Phase 6: Optimization (Weeks 16-18)
- Performance tuning
- Accuracy validation
- Load testing
- Production deployment

## ✅ Success Criteria

1. **Accuracy**: 96-98% on technical standards questions
2. **Performance**: <1s response time (P95)
3. **Explainability**: Complete proof chains for all answers
4. **Reliability**: Fallback to vector search when needed
5. **Scalability**: Handle 100+ concurrent queries

## 🔧 Key Advantages

1. **True Understanding**: Symbolic logic captures actual requirements
2. **Explainable**: Proof chains show reasoning
3. **Accurate**: Templates prevent hallucination
4. **Efficient**: Front-loaded processing at ingestion
5. **Reliable**: Multiple fallback mechanisms

## 📈 Comparison: v2 vs v3

| Aspect | v2 (Neural-Heavy) | v3 (Neurosymbolic) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Accuracy Target | 99% (unrealistic) | 96-98% (achievable) |
| Primary Method | Neural + MongoDB | Symbolic + Graph |
| Response Generation | LLM-based | Template-based |
| Explainability | Limited | Complete proof chains |
| Hallucination Risk | Medium | Near-zero |
| Query Speed | Variable | Consistent <1s |

## 🎖️ Why Neurosymbolic?

Technical standards documents have unique characteristics:
- **Structured Requirements**: Perfect for logic programming
- **Complex Dependencies**: Ideal for graph databases
- **Need for Accuracy**: Templates ensure correctness
- **Audit Requirements**: Proof chains provide traceability
- **No Creativity Needed**: Deterministic answers preferred

The neurosymbolic approach leverages these characteristics to achieve unprecedented accuracy without the hallucination risks of pure neural approaches.

## 📚 Key Documents

1. **[MASTER-ARCHITECTURE-v3.md](./MASTER-ARCHITECTURE-v3.md)**: Complete neurosymbolic design
2. **[CONSTRAINTS.md](./CONSTRAINTS.md)**: Binding technical constraints
3. **[IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md](./IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md)**: 18-week execution plan

## ⚠️ Important Note

The `OBSOLETE_v2/` directory contains the previous neural-heavy architecture. It is retained for reference but should not be used for new development. All work should follow the v3 neurosymbolic approach.
