# ruv-fann Neural Integration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic placement of ruv-fann neural networks for maximum impact across the Doc-RAG system. With ruv-fann v0.1.6 already implemented in the chunker module achieving 84.8% accuracy in boundary detection, we identify four additional strategic placement points to enhance accuracy without adding complexity.

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Existing Implementation
- **Chunker Module**: ruv-fann v0.1.6 for neural boundary detection
  - Architecture: 12 input features â†’ 16 hidden â†’ 8 hidden â†’ 4 outputs
  - Performance: 84.8% accuracy, <5ms inference time
  - Model: Lightweight networks optimized for real-time processing

### ðŸ”„ Existing Neural Infrastructure
- **Embedder Module**: Candle/ONNX for embeddings (heavyweight, high accuracy)
- **Query Processor**: Rule-based classification (room for neural enhancement)
- **Response Generator**: Pattern-based scoring (opportunity for neural ranking)

## Strategic Placement Plan

### 1. Query Understanding Enhancement
**Location**: `src/query-processor/src/classifier.rs`
**Purpose**: Replace rule-based intent classification with neural classification

```rust
// Target Integration
pub struct NeuralQueryClassifier {
    intent_network: ruv_fann::Network<f32>,     // 3-layer, 128 neurons
    complexity_network: ruv_fann::Network<f32>, // 2-layer, 64 neurons
}

// Model Architecture
- Input: 15 query features (length, entities, question words, etc.)
- Hidden: 128 â†’ 64 neurons with sigmoid activation
- Output: 8 intent classes + confidence scores
- Target: <8ms inference, >90% accuracy
```

**Impact**: Improved intent classification accuracy from ~75% to >90%

### 2. Response Ranking Optimization  
**Location**: `src/response-generator/src/scorer.rs`
**Purpose**: Neural scoring for response relevance and quality

```rust
// Target Integration
pub struct NeuralResponseScorer {
    relevance_network: ruv_fann::Network<f32>,  // 4-layer, 256 neurons
    quality_network: ruv_fann::Network<f32>,    // 3-layer, 128 neurons
}

// Model Architecture
- Input: 20 response features (semantic match, citation quality, coherence)
- Hidden: 256 â†’ 128 â†’ 64 neurons with ReLU activation  
- Output: Relevance score + quality score + confidence
- Target: <10ms inference, 2.5x accuracy improvement
```

**Impact**: Better response ranking leading to higher user satisfaction

### 3. Cache Prediction Intelligence
**Location**: `src/integration/src/cache_predictor.rs` (new module)
**Purpose**: Predict cache hit probability and optimal caching strategies

```rust
// Target Integration  
pub struct NeuralCachePredictor {
    hit_predictor: ruv_fann::Network<f32>,    // 2-layer, 64 neurons
    ttl_optimizer: ruv_fann::Network<f32>,    // 2-layer, 32 neurons
}

// Model Architecture
- Input: 8 cache features (query pattern, user context, time of day)
- Hidden: 64 â†’ 32 neurons with tanh activation
- Output: Hit probability + optimal TTL
- Target: <3ms inference, 40% cache hit improvement
```

**Impact**: Reduced query latency through intelligent caching

### 4. Multi-Modal Content Analysis (Future)
**Location**: `src/chunker/src/content_analyzer.rs` (enhancement)
**Purpose**: Enhanced content type detection beyond current boundary detection

```rust
// Future Enhancement
pub struct MultiModalAnalyzer {
    content_classifier: ruv_fann::Network<f32>, // 3-layer, 128 neurons
    structure_detector: ruv_fann::Network<f32>,  // 2-layer, 96 neurons
}

// Target for Phase 3
- Enhanced table detection: >95% accuracy
- Code block classification: Support for 15+ languages
- Mathematical content identification
```

| Response Scorer | <10ms | <3MB | >85% |
| Cache Predictor | <3ms | <1MB | >80% hit prediction |
| Current Chunker | <5ms | <2MB | 84.8% (achieved) |

### System-Wide Impact
- **Overall Latency**: Maintain <95ms total query processing
- **Memory Footprint**: Additional <8MB for all neural models
- **Accuracy Boost**: 15-25% improvement across components
- **Resource Efficiency**: 2.8x faster than heavyweight alternatives

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Query Classification (Week 1-2)
1. **Model Development**
   - Create training dataset from existing queries
   - Design 3-layer network architecture
   - Train with synthetic data augmentation
   - Validate against held-out test set

2. **Integration Points**
   ```rust
   // In query-processor/src/classifier.rs
   impl IntentClassifier {
       pub async fn classify_neural(&self, query: &str) -> Result<IntentClassification> {
           let features = self.extract_query_features(query)?;
           let output = self.intent_network.run(&features);
           self.interpret_neural_output(&output)
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Fallback Strategy**
   - Maintain existing rule-based classification as fallback
   - Gradual rollout with A/B testing
   - Performance monitoring and rollback capability

### Phase 2: Response Scoring (Week 3-4)  
1. **Model Architecture**
   - Dual-network approach: relevance + quality
   - Training on human-labeled response quality data
   - Integration with existing citation tracking

2. **Hybrid Approach**
   ```rust
   // In response-generator/src/scorer.rs
   pub struct HybridScorer {
       neural_scorer: NeuralResponseScorer,
       rule_based_scorer: RuleBasedScorer, // Fallback
       confidence_threshold: f32,
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Cache Intelligence (Week 5-6)
1. **Data Collection**
   - Analyze existing cache patterns
   - User behavior analytics
   - Query clustering for pattern recognition

2. **Lightweight Implementation**

   - Fast inference (<3ms)
   - Integration with FACT caching system

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### Candle Compatibility
- **Keep Candle**: Continue using for heavyweight embeddings
- **Complement**: ruv-fann for real-time, lightweight inference
- **Interop**: Shared feature extraction where possible

```rust
// Example hybrid approach
pub struct HybridEmbedder {
    candle_embedder: CandleEmbedder,     // High-quality embeddings
    ruv_fann_classifier: NetworkClassifier, // Fast content classification
}
```

### FACT Integration
- **Cache Keys**: Include neural predictions in cache keys  
- **Smart Invalidation**: Use neural patterns to predict cache staleness
- **Performance Metrics**: Track neural vs cached performance

### Monitoring and Observability
```rust
// Neural performance tracking
pub struct NeuralMetrics {
    inference_times: Vec<Duration>,
    accuracy_scores: Vec<f64>,
    fallback_triggers: u64,
    cache_predictions: CachePredictionMetrics,
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Safeguards

2. **Timeout Protection**: 50ms max inference time with fallback
3. **Memory Monitoring**: Alert if neural models exceed memory budget
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Feature flags for safe deployment

### Quality Assurance

## Conclusion

This strategic ruv-fann integration plan provides a clear path to enhance Doc-RAG accuracy while maintaining the lightweight, fast-inference philosophy that makes ruv-fann ideal for production RAG systems. By focusing on four high-impact integration points - query classification, response scoring, cache intelligence, and future multi-modal analysis - we can achieve significant performance gains without the complexity overhead of heavyweight neural frameworks.

The hybrid approach preserves existing Candle-based embeddings for heavyweight operations while introducing ruv-fann for real-time inference, creating a balanced neural architecture optimized for both accuracy and speed.
