## MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS - NEUROSYMBOLIC APPROACH

### 1. Symbolic Reasoning (Primary) 🔤

#### **CONSTRAINT-001: Logic Programming Foundation**
- **MUST** use Datalog (Crepe) for requirement rules and inference
- **MUST** use Prolog (Scryer) for complex reasoning fallback
- **MUST** achieve <100ms logic query response time
- **MUST** generate complete proof chains for all answers

**Rationale:** 
- Symbolic reasoning provides deterministic, explainable results
- Logic programming captures actual requirements without hallucination
- Proof chains required for compliance audit trails

**Violation Consequences:**
- ❌ Loss of explainability and auditability
- ❌ Inability to guarantee correctness for compliance queries
- ❌ Failure to meet 96-98% accuracy requirement

---

### 2. Graph Database (Primary Storage) 🕸️

#### **CONSTRAINT-002: Neo4j Knowledge Graph**
- **MUST** use Neo4j v5.0+ for relationship storage
- **MUST** model requirements as nodes with typed edges
- **MUST** achieve <200ms graph traversal for 3-hop queries
- **KEEP** MongoDB for document storage only

**Rationale:**
- Graph relationships are first-class citizens in technical standards
- Neo4j provides native Cypher query language for complex traversals
- Relationships (DEPENDS_ON, REFERENCES, EXCEPTION) critical for accuracy

**Violation Consequences:**
- ❌ Cannot model complex requirement dependencies
- ❌ Loss of relationship-based reasoning
- ❌ Inability to answer "what depends on X" queries

---

### 3. Neural Components (Classification Only) 🧠

#### **CONSTRAINT-003: ruv-fann for Classification**
- **MUST** use ruv-fann v0.1.6 for classification tasks only
- **MUST NOT** use neural networks for text generation
- **MUST** achieve <10ms inference per classification
- **MUST** limit to: document type, section type, query routing

**Rationale:**
- Neural networks excel at classification, not generation
- Classification provides routing to appropriate symbolic processor
- Fast inference enables real-time query routing

**Violation Consequences:**
- ❌ Neural generation leads to hallucination
- ❌ Performance degradation from heavy models
- ❌ Loss of deterministic responses

---

### 4. Response Generation (Templates) 📝

#### **CONSTRAINT-004: Template-Based Responses**
- **MUST** use templates for response generation
- **MUST NOT** use free-form LLM generation
- **MUST** support variable substitution from proof chains
- **MUST** include complete citations in all responses

**Rationale:**
- Templates prevent hallucination completely
- Structured responses ensure consistency
- Citations provide full traceability

**Violation Consequences:**
- ❌ Risk of hallucinated responses
- ❌ Inconsistent answer formats
- ❌ Missing compliance audit trail

---

### 5. Vector Search (Fallback Only) 🔍

#### **CONSTRAINT-005: Qdrant for Semantic Fallback**
- **MUST** use Qdrant only when symbolic/graph fail
- **MUST** maintain confidence threshold of 0.85
- **MUST** log all fallback usage for analysis
- **SHOULD** aim for <20% fallback rate

**Rationale:**
- Vector search is last resort for unstructured queries
- High threshold prevents low-quality matches
- Fallback logging identifies gaps in symbolic coverage

**Violation Consequences:**
- ❌ Over-reliance on vector search reduces accuracy
- ❌ Loss of explainability for vector-only results
- ❌ Inability to provide proof chains

---

### 6. Performance Requirements 🎯

#### **CONSTRAINT-006: System Performance**
- **MUST** achieve 96-98% accuracy (realistic target)
- **MUST** maintain <1s query response (symbolic path)
- **MUST** support <2s response for complex queries
- **MUST** handle 100+ QPS with horizontal scaling

**Rationale:**
- 96-98% is realistic with neurosymbolic approach
- Symbolic queries are fast and deterministic
- Complex queries may require graph traversal

**Violation Consequences:**
- ❌ Unrealistic accuracy claims damage credibility
- ❌ Slow responses impact user experience
- ❌ Cannot scale to enterprise requirements

## NEUROSYMBOLIC IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

### Phase 1: Symbolic Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
1. **Setup Datalog/Prolog engines** - Core reasoning infrastructure
2. **Deploy Neo4j graph database** - Relationship storage
3. **Build neural classifiers** - Document/section/query routing

### Phase 2: Loading Pipeline (Weeks 4-6) 
4. **Implement requirement extractor** - Neural extraction to logic
5. **Create logic parser** - Requirements to Datalog rules
6. **Build graph relationships** - Cross-references and dependencies

### Phase 3: Query & Response (Weeks 7-12)
7. **Symbolic query processor** - Logic inference with proof chains
8. **Template response engine** - Structured, citation-backed answers
9. **Integration testing** - End-to-end validation

## NEUROSYMBOLIC CONSTRAINT MATRIX

| Constraint | Priority | Risk Level | New Components | Estimated Effort |
|------------|----------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| CONSTRAINT-001 (Logic Programming) | P0 | CRITICAL | Datalog, Prolog | 3-4 weeks |
| CONSTRAINT-002 (Neo4j Graph) | P0 | HIGH | Graph DB | 2-3 weeks |
| CONSTRAINT-003 (Neural Classification) | P0 | MEDIUM | Classifiers | 2-3 weeks |
| CONSTRAINT-004 (Templates) | P0 | CRITICAL | Template Engine | 2-3 weeks |
| CONSTRAINT-005 (Vector Fallback) | P1 | LOW | Qdrant | 1 week |
| CONSTRAINT-006 (Performance) | P0 | HIGH | ALL | Ongoing |

## NEUROSYMBOLIC VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Acceptance Tests
- ✅ Logic queries return proof chains
- ✅ Graph traversal <200ms (3-hop)
- ✅ Neural classification <10ms
- ✅ Templates generate all responses
- ✅ Vector fallback <20% of queries
- ✅ End-to-end <1s for simple queries
- ✅ 96-98% accuracy achieved

### Component Validation
- ✅ Datalog rules correctly infer requirements
- ✅ Neo4j stores all relationships
- ✅ Classifiers achieve >95% accuracy
- ✅ Templates have 100% citation coverage

## NEUROSYMBOLIC RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Logic Engine Performance** - May not scale to large rule sets
2. **Graph Database Learning Curve** - Team needs Neo4j expertise
3. **Template Coverage** - Cannot template all possible queries

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Hybrid approach** - Combine templates with constrained generation
- **Training investment** - Neo4j certification for team
- **Incremental migration** - Keep MongoDB as fallback initially
- **Performance profiling** - Identify bottlenecks early

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### Core Tenets
1. **Symbolic First**: Logic and rules before neural networks
2. **Explainable Always**: Every answer has a proof chain
3. **Deterministic Responses**: Templates prevent hallucination
4. **Graph Relationships**: First-class modeling of dependencies
5. **Neural for Classification**: Not generation

### Design Philosophy
- "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"
- Process documents intelligently at load time
- Query time should be retrieval, not computation
- Proof chains provide audit trails
- Templates ensure consistency
