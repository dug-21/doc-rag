Neural networks can enhance this process by learning to identify semantic boundaries. Unlike simple rule-based approaches, neural networks can understand context and meaning.

The ruv-fann library provides a powerful Rust implementation of neural networks. It supports various activation functions and training algorithms, making it ideal for boundary detection tasks.

In this example, we demonstrate how to use neural networks for intelligent document chunking. The system learns to identify natural break points based on content analysis and semantic understanding.";
