# Phase 2 Query Processing Enhancement - Research Findings

## RESEARCHER Agent Analysis Summary

### Architecture Constraints Analysis

**CONSTRAINT-001: Logic Programming Foundation**

### Integration Points Available

**Query Processor Integration:**
- `QueryProcessor` with symbolic router at `src/query-processor/src/lib.rs`
- `route_query_to_engine()` method for engine selection
- `convert_query_to_logic()` for Datalog/Prolog conversion
- `generate_query_proof_chain()` for symbolic reasoning

**Response Generator Integration:**
- `ResponseGenerator` with template engine at `src/response-generator/src/lib.rs`
- `TemplateEngine` for deterministic response generation
- `EnhancedCitationFormatter` with audit trails
- Complete FACT cache integration for <50ms performance

### London TDD Methodology Requirements

**Testing Approach:**
- Write failing tests BEFORE implementation
- Use extensive mocking and behavior verification
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Focus on outside-in development
- Test doubles for external dependencies

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- 100% core API coverage minimum
- Performance constraint validation tests
- Error handling and edge case tests
- Integration tests with existing components
- Behavioral tests for symbolic reasoning
