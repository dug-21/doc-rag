## London TDD Methodology Compliance

### ✅ Test Structure Validation
- **Given-When-Then Structure**: Implemented across all test suites
- **Behavior Verification**: Mock-based testing for isolation
- **Outside-in Development**: Comprehensive mock usage with `mockall`
- **Test-first Approach**: Extensive test coverage with failing-first implementation

### ✅ Specific Compliance Points
1. **Behavioral Focus**: Tests verify behavior over state
2. **Mock Usage**: Extensive use of `MockSymbolicQueryRouter`, `MockTemplateEngine`, etc.
3. **Isolation**: Each test runs in isolation with mocked dependencies
4. **Outside-in**: Tests define expected behavior before implementation
