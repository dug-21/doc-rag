## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Autonomous Health Monitoring
```rust
// Continuous monitoring with configurable thresholds
pub async fn mrap_monitor(&self) -> Result<()> {
    let current_metrics = self.collect_system_metrics().await;
    
    // Health score analysis
    for (name, _component) in components.iter() {
        if *health_score < 0.7 {
            // Create SystemIssue with severity classification
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Action Planning  
```rust
// Severity-based action determination
let actions = match (issue.issue_type.as_str(), issue.severity) {
    ("Low Health Score", IssueSeverity::Critical) => {
        vec![ActionType::Restart, ActionType::HealthCheck]
    },
    ("High Error Rate", IssueSeverity::Critical) => {
        vec![ActionType::Isolate]
    },
    // Additional patterns...
};
```

### 3. Autonomous Execution
```rust
// Self-executing corrective actions
match action.action_type {
    ActionType::Restart => {
        // Restart component and update health status
        let mut components = self.components.write().await;
        if let Some(component) = components.get_mut(&action.target) {
            component.health_status = ComponentHealthStatus::Healthy;
        }
    },
    // Additional action types...
}
```

### 4. Learning-Based Adaptation
```rust
// Success rate analysis for strategy adaptation
for (action_type, (total, successful)) in action_stats {
    let success_rate = successful as f64 / total as f64;
    if success_rate < 0.5 && total >= 5 {
        // Reduce usage of ineffective actions
    } else if success_rate > 0.8 && total >= 3 {
        // Prioritize highly effective actions
    }
}
```
