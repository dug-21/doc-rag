## Previous Integration + NEW Handler Enhancement

## What Was Previously Accomplished

### âœ… Files Removed (4,000+ lines eliminated)

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Custom Implementation)
```rust
SystemIntegration {
    coordinator: Arc<IntegrationCoordinator>,     // 592 lines
    service_discovery: Arc<ServiceDiscovery>,     // 712 lines  
    circuit_breaker: CircuitBreakerRegistry,     // 572 lines
    // Custom consensus would have been ~600 lines
    // Total: ~2,476 lines of orchestration code
}
```

### After (DAA Integration)
```rust
SystemIntegration {
    daa_orchestrator: Arc<RwLock<DAAOrchestrator>>, // 600 lines wrapper
    // Backed by claude-flow and ruv-swarm MCP tools
    // Total: 600 lines + proven MCP libraries
}
```
