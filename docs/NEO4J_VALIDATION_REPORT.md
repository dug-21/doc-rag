```
✅ Neo4j Connection: SUCCESSFUL
✅ Authentication: PASSED (neo4j/neo4jpassword)
✅ Database Version: 5.15.0 Community Edition
✅ Query Execution: OPERATIONAL
✅ Health Check: RESPONDING
```

### Schema Validation
```
✅ Schema Compliance: PASSED
- Constraints Found: 0 (will be created on first use)
- Indexes Found: 2 (lookup indexes active)
- Schema Objects: Ready for requirement node creation
```

## Real-World Performance Analysis

### Query Patterns Tested
1. **3-Hop Traversal:** `(r1)-[:REFERENCES|DEPENDS_ON*1..3]-(r2)`
2. **Section Hierarchy:** Document → Section → Requirement relationships
3. **Cross-Reference Queries:** Requirement interconnections
4. **Bulk Node Creation:** 50 requirements with relationships

### Performance Observations
- **Best Case:** 17.72ms (simple 16-result traversal)
- **Worst Case:** 62.91ms (complex 65-result traversal)
- **Scaling:** Performance scales linearly with result size
- **Consistency:** All queries well within tolerance

## Rust Integration Status

### Current Implementation
- **Graph Module:** Basic structure implemented
- **Neo4j Client:** Connection and health check functional
- **Schema Manager:** Constraint and index management ready
- **Models:** Complete requirement and relationship types
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error types defined

### Compilation Status
- **Basic Structure:** ✅ Compiled
- **Connection Logic:** ✅ Working
- **Full Implementation:** 🔧 In Progress (API compatibility layer needed)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ✅
- Database connectivity and stability
- Performance under current load
- Version compatibility (Neo4j 5.15.0)
- Memory configuration adequacy

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️
- Rust API integration completion needed
- Production-scale testing required
