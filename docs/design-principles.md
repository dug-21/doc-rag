# RAG System Design Principles

## Core Philosophy
Building a high-accuracy RAG system requires unwavering commitment to quality, completeness, and reliability at every level.

## üéØ Fundamental Principles

### 1. No Placeholders or Stubs
- **Every component must be fully functional** when committed
- No TODO comments in production code
- No stubbed methods or fake implementations
- Reward thorough, complete implementations over quick prototypes

### 2. Integrate first then develop
 - **Leverage ruv-FANN, DAA, FACT Libraries**
 - NO building neural models (ruvFANN)
 - NO building autonomous agents or orchestration (DAA)

### 3. Building Block Architecture
- **Start with the smallest testable unit** and build outward
- Each component must be independently valuable and testable
- Components should have clear boundaries and interfaces
- No monolithic implementations

### 4. Test-First Development
- **Write tests before implementation**
- Each building block must have:
  - Unit tests (>90% coverage)
  - Integration tests
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Validation criteria
- Tests are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts

### 5. Real Data, Real Results
- **Use actual data structures** from day one
- No mock data in core components
- Test with real document samples
- Validate against actual compliance requirements

### 6. Error Handling Excellence
- **Every error must be handled explicitly**
- No silent failures
- Comprehensive logging at appropriate levels
- Graceful degradation where applicable

### 7. Performance by Design
- **Performance targets defined upfront**
- Benchmark every component
- Optimize based on measurements, not assumptions
- Sub-component latency budgets

### 8. Security First
- **Security cannot be retrofitted**
- Authentication and authorization from the start
- Audit logging for all operations
- Quantum-resistant where applicable

### 9. Observable by Default
- **Every component must be observable**
- Structured logging
- Metrics exposure
- Distributed tracing support
- Health checks and readiness probes

### 10. Documentation as Code
- **Documentation lives with the code**
- Self-documenting code with clear naming
- Inline documentation for complex logic
- Architecture decisions recorded

### 11. Reproducible Everything
- **All builds must be reproducible**
- Dockerized from the start
- Version lock all dependencies
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Infrastructure as code


## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Standards

### Rust Development
- Use `clippy` with pedantic lints
- Format with `rustfmt`
- Safe Rust by default, `unsafe` only when necessary and documented
- Async/await with tokio throughout

### Testing Standards
- Test file alongside implementation
- Property-based testing where applicable
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical paths
- Integration tests in separate directory

### Docker Standards
- Multi-stage builds for minimal images
- Non-root users in containers
- Health checks mandatory
- Resource limits defined

### CI/CD Standards
- Every push triggers tests
- No merge without green builds
- Automated security scanning
- Performance regression detection

## üìê Architecture Principles

### Component Independence
- Components communicate through well-defined interfaces
- No circular dependencies
- Loose coupling, high cohesion
- Event-driven where appropriate

### Data Flow Clarity
- Unidirectional data flow where possible
- Clear ownership of data transformations
- Immutable data structures preferred
- Explicit state management

### Consensus and Validation
- Multiple validation layers
- Byzantine fault tolerance built-in
- No single points of failure
- Explicit trust boundaries

## üéØ Success Metrics

Every component must define and meet:
- **Functional completeness**: Does it do what it claims?
- **Performance targets**: Does it meet latency/throughput requirements?
- **Reliability metrics**: What's the error rate?
- **Test coverage**: Are edge cases covered?
- **Documentation completeness**: Can someone else maintain it?

## üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- "We'll add tests later"
- "This is just a prototype"
- "It works on my machine"
- "We'll optimize if it becomes a problem"
- "Documentation can wait"
- "We'll add security in phase 2"
- "Let's just mock this for now"

## ‚úÖ Decision Framework

When making technical decisions, ask:
1. Is there other code or library in this codebase that performs this function?
2. Is this the simplest solution that fully solves the problem?
3. Can this be tested in isolation?
4. Will this scale to our performance requirements?
5. Is this secure by design?
6. Can another developer understand this in 6 months?
7. Does this follow our established patterns?

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

- Regular architecture reviews
- Performance profiling sessions
- Security audits
- Dependency updates
- Technical debt tracking and resolution

*These principles are not suggestions‚Äîthey are requirements. Every line of code, every design decision, and every component must embody these principles.*
