2. Response-Generator: Unterminated string in cache.rs:776
3. Query-Processor: 1 compilation error (details pending)
4. Integration: DAA dependency imports missing

ACHIEVEMENT: 93% error reduction (from 62 to 4 errors)
STATUS: Ready for final elimination phase - errors are specific and fixable

Target: 0 errors for all packages
Next: Monitor for zero error achievement
